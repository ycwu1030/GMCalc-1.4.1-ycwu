GMCALC -- changes log

2022/08/04 - version 1.5.3:
	     Fixed bugs in src/gmhbhs.f that affected HiggsBounds results
	     when h, H, or H30 masses are close to the ttbar threshold.

2022/07/04 - version 1.5.2:
	     Modified vegas.f to comply with fortran 2018 standards
	     (NO change to the algorithm).
	     Tested with LoopTools 2.16.

2022/06/04 - version 1.5.1:
	     Updated CMS direct search for VBF -> H5++/-- (2104.04762).
	     Incorporated new ATLAS direct search for Drell-Yan H++H-- 
	     -> 4W (2101.11961).

2021/02/05 - version 1.5.0:
             Added interface to call HiggsBounds-5 and HiggsSignals-2.
	     Added routines to apply direct constraints from VBF -> H5++, 
             Drell-Yan H5++, and Drell-Yan H50 --> gamma gamma, which 
	     are not in HiggsBounds 5.3.0.
             Rewrote calculation of MSQ22 in READIN2 to properly handle 
             v_chi = 0 case.

2018/09/30 - version 1.4.1 (new inputset):
	     Added INPUTSET 6 (mh, m5, sin(thetaH), lambda2, lambda3,
	     lambda4, lambda5, M2).

2018/07/25 - version 1.4.0: 
	     gmmg5.f now also generates a param_card for the (LO) 
	     UFO model file with effective vertices for loop-induced 
	     Higgs decays.
	     Improved integration speed for scalar decay widths to 
	     doubly-offshell vector boson pairs.
             Updated makefile to work with LoopTools 2.15.
	     Updated S and T parameters to PDG2018 values.
	     Bug fixed in H3+ --> W- H5++ width calculation.
	     Offshell H1 -> V* H2 set to zero when V -> H1 H2 is 
	     possible: formula used was not valid in that region.

2017/08/30 - version 1.3.0:
	     One-loop decays of H5+ --> W+ gamma, H3+ --> W+ gamma,
	     and H50 --> Z gamma are now computed as in C.Degrande, 
	     K.Hartling & H.E.Logan, arXiv:1708.08753.  Computation of 
	     these decays requires linking LoopTools; see 
	     www.feynarts.de/looptools/ .  See the makefile for compilation
	     without LoopTools, i.e., setting these decays to zero.

2016/06/20 - version 1.2.1 (new inputset):
             Added INPUTSET 5 (mh, mH, sin(thetaH), sin(alpha), lambda2,
             lambda3, lambda4, lambda5).

2015/11/30 - version 1.2.0:
             Doubly-offshell H -> V*V* decays implemented for all masses;
	     numerics validated using HDECAY 6.42 to be good to within 1%.
             New inputs GAMZ and GAMW are the physical widths of the Z and W.
	     gmmg5.f updated to produce LO and NLO param-cards for use with 
	     the corresponding UFO model files.  Widths set to Auto so that
	     they will be calculated by MadGraph.

2015/08/11 - version 1.1.1 (bug fixes):
	     Bugs fixed in h, H, H3^0, and H5^0 decays to Z gamma - thanks
	     to Celine Degrande.

2015/03/26 - version 1.1.0: 
	     Added INPUTSET 4 (mh, m5, sH, lambda2, lambda3, lambda4, M1, M2).
	     Changed default EW input parameters to GF, MZ, MW.
	     Added consistency check for INPUTSET 3.

2015/01/20 - version 1.0.1 (bug fixes):
	     Fixed the handling of a singular case in the routine that finds
	     roots of the cubic equation for VCHI in gmspectrum.f - thanks 
  	     to R. Ruiz for pointing out this bug.
	     Fixed the code that chooses VCHI positive in gmscan.f.

2014/12/19 - added INPUTSET 3 (physical masses and mixing angles)
2014/12/15 - changed variable name in param_card.dat (to match FeynRules)
2014/11/12 - bug fixed in GET_MINMASS in src/gmutils.f
2014/11/07 - first public version of GMCALC v1.0
